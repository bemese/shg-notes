Eq. I15
--------
calpmn - we had already tried to place this code.

eq. G2 is already coded. compare to eq. I15. These two can be stuck in the same subroutine and are possible completed already.

so what I have to do is code eq. I15, I17, and verify that I17 yields the same result as G2 which is already coded.
