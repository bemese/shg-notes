In the first part, we describe various approaches to go beyond the long-wavelength limit perturbation theoretical approach in the independent particle approximation for linear optical response functions. In the latter, electron–electron interaction effects are only included in as far as they are implicit in the underlying band structure (typically within the local density functional approximation). We discuss the inclusion of quasiparticle corrections to the band structures, local-field and electron–hole interaction effects. A case study of {GaN} is used to illustrate the discrepancies between theory and experiment that arise from neglect of these effects. On the other hand, the paper also illustrates that in the process of extracting the band structure information from optical spectra, the independent particle model still plays a central role. In the case of nonlinear optical response, even the independent particle model was only recently fully developed. Recent progress in this area and their implementation within the context of first-principles band structure methods is presented next. Some examples are used to illustrate the potentially richer information contained in {NLO} spectra in relation to the underlying band structures. Secondly, progress in understanding the trends in {NLO} coefficients in some classes of materials is illustrated with a study of chalcopyrites.},

When the bulk crystals have inversion symmetry, the only dipole-allowed response involves the interface; however, the analysis is much more complicated than with small molecules, and we must develop a qualitative theory of the relevant physics. Here, I propose a closed-form expression for the intensity and apply it to a simple model based essentially on a combination of Fresnel’s formulas and a solvable linear chain. The theory allows one to study the second-harmonic spectrum as a function of substrate band structure and plasma frequency, overlayer chemical properties, and experimental geometry. The model is very flexible, and can mimic a variety of electronic structures. Here, for the purpose of illustration, I focus on semiconductors covered by a monolayer of adatoms. The results show that a high degree of surface sensitivity is indeed attained and the (generally very weak) intensity is enhanced when the overlayer is chemically unlike the bulk of the crystal. Particularly strong signals are predicted in a range about the plasma frequency, if the overlayer-induced transitions have high enough energy.},

This method is incorrect as it violates specific sum rules. We give a consistent implementation that respects the sum rules: ranm(k) and ranm;b(k), when written in terms of momentum matrix elements and energy eigenvalues, should be evaluated within Kohn–Sham {LDA} and not with the scissored one.

The terms are rearranged in such a way as to exhibit explicitly all required symmetries including the Kleinman symmetry in the static limit. Computational details and convergence tests are presented. The calculated frequency-dependent χ(2)(-2ω,ω,ω) for the zinc-blende materials {GaAs}, {GaP} and wurtzite {GaN} and {AlN} are found to be in excellent agreement with that obtained by other first-principles calculations when corrections to the local density approximation are implemented in the same manner, namely, using the “scissors” approach. Similar agreement is found for the static values of χ(2) for zinc-blende {GaN}, {AlN}, {BN}, and {SiC}. The strict validity of the usual “scissors” operator implementation is, however, questioned. We show that better agreement with experiment is obtained when the corrections to the low-lying conduction bands are applied at the level of the Hamiltonian, which guarantees that eigenvectors are consistent with the eigenvalues. Results are presented for the frequency-dependent χ(2)(-2ω,ω,ω) for 3C−{SiC}. The approach is found to be very efficient and flexible, which indicates that it will be useful for a wide variety of material systems including those with many atoms in the unit cell.},

The dimer formed between the top-most Si atoms and the sublayer atoms give a surface with a C1v symmetry class, characterized by ten non-zero elements of the non-linear surface susceptibility tensor χ↔. This symmetry gives rise to a second-harmonic signal that is anisotropic in the azimuthal angle φ which the incident plane of the fundamental beam of frequency ω makes with the surface plane. The anisotropy depends on the surface or bulk nature of the {SH} resonance. In particular, the spectral range around the Si E1 critical point is investigated.},

In particular Si/{SiO}2 interfaces have been studied extensively and significant progress has been made in understanding the sensitivity of second-harmonic generation to interface defects, steps, strain, roughness, electric fields, carrier dynamics, and chemical modifications. The macroscopic and microscopic aspects of the second-order nonlinear optical effects at buried semiconductor interfaces have been treated theoretically by first-principles calculations and semi-empirical models.

The ab initio theory identifies the source of this short-coming as the stronger contribution of optical transitions involving surface atom/adatom states to the {SHG} response, and is then used to quantify additional {SETBM} parameters describing these transitions, resulting in a complete, accurate, and convenient description of surface orbital hybridization and experimental results.},
