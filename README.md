Length Gauge Theory of Surface Second Harmonic Generation
=========================================================

Abstract
------------
We present a theoretical review of surface second harmonic generation (SHG) from semiconductor surfaces based on the longitudinal gauge. This layer-by-layer analysis is carefully presented in order to show how a surface SHG calculation can be readily evaluated. The nonlinear susceptibility tensor for a surface, χS (−2ω; ω, ω) is split into two terms relating to inter-band and intra-band one-electron transitions.
