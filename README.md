EQ 81:
Substitute A and B and w_lm --> w^s_lm
Leads to Eq. A09, then subsitute w_vc --> -w_cv
and you have the final equation for inter at w and 2w

So you have to do the same for equation EQ82 following the same procedure. You can start from the first three lines of A13. Anything after that is unreliable.

The goal is A16 and A19 but written in terms of w^s_nm and V^sigma

Once programmed in Tiniba, temporarily use calMomMatElem instead of our new V^sigma

Look at equation F4
